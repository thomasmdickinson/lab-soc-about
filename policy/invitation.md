Please don't feel slighted if I don't ever choose to invite you because I am
only ever going to invite a small number of people.

I'm not sure exactly how I'll decide who to invite but these are the criteria
I'll be thinking about.

* you and I know each other, and we've been friendly acquaintances for at least
  a year or two.
* you are pretty sure you're sincerely interested in being an active user.
  Ideally this means you're already into the fediverse or very very excited to
  jump in.
* you and I have relatively similar values. if you are not comfortable using
  people's preferred names and pronouns, or you think "antifa" refers to
  something bad or scary, this is probably not a great place for you
* you have considered the security risks inherent to mastodon, and the risks of
  trusting some friend of yours who runs a mastodon server. Some further notes
  and explanations are posted [here](privacy.md).

If you think you fit those criteria and you'd be interested to join, reach out to me 
and let me know!

P.S.: If you're thinking of joining the fediverse but aren't sure about this
community, I recommend you join [another server](http://joinmastodon.org/).
We can always consider whether it makes sense for you to move here at a later time.
