## It Matters Whether You Trust Me Personally

When we speak about privacy and security on large corporate social media
platforms, we are usually referring to their data policies in a large-scale and
impersonal context, like whether they will track you, build advertising profiles
on you, perform social experiments on users, or sell the data to third parties.
With a small social network hosted by someone you personally know, you do not
usually have to worry about about that. But there are other things you might
want to consider.

For instance, whatever social platform you are using, a person with sufficiently
high levels of access can, in theory, read your DMs (unless they are end-to-end
encrypted, and on most platforms they are not). But for the most cases, you do
not expect any employees at the corporation to have a particular personal
interest in you that might motivate them to browse your personal private data.
You cannot make that same assumption when signing up to a social network run by
someone you know.

Before using this service, please consider the access you are giving me, and
consider whether you trust me enough to be comfortable giving me that access.

## Where Your Data Goes

All posts, mentions, Direct Messages (DMs), and profile data are hosted on a
Linode server run by the admin. All content is stored in a plaintext
unencrypted format at present. The nonprofit that maintains Mastodon have
indicated that in the future they may implement end-to-end encryption for Direct
Messages, but at this time no such encryption is used.

All uploaded images are hosted either on the same server or in an Amazon S3
bucket owned by the admin. All images are publicly accessible, if you know the
image's URL.

The section "Admin Access on labyrinth.social" below, specifies the admin's
policies and commitments regarding accessing user data.

However, as with all "fediverse" services, Mastodon/Hometown posts can be and
often are made available to users on other servers. This is referred to as
"federation." Once your post has been federated to another server, that server
has a copy of your post and there is absolutely no guarantee that the users of
that server will abide by the policies of this server, or even respect the
private/public setting of your post.

Additionally, regular backups are made of the server, which means that material
you have deleted may be retained in a backup.

Therefore, please think of the privacy measures of Mastodon/Hometown as barriers
and impediments, not unbreakable forcefields, and do not use this or any other
non-encrypted fediverse service to exchange pictures or images that you would
find devastating if they were made public.

## Admin Access to labyrinth.social Data

Keep in mind that even when the Mastodon/Hometown software does not allow for
it, the admin's server access *does* allow them to do the following:

* view direct messages, even when they are not directed to me
* view "followers only" posts from people who have not allowed me to follow them
* browse the Amazon AWS S3 Bucket to see all images, even those shared in posts
  the Mastodon/Hometown software would not ordinarily allow me to see.  

It's important to me to disclose that I can do these things, but it's equally
important that **I promise you I will not do these things**, with possible
exceptions in the following situations:

* When I am required by law (for instance, if I am legally required to do so in
  order to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation)
* In order to investigate an abuse/harassment report (and then, only with the
  complainant's consent)
* In order to investigate a technical bug or issue (and then, only with the
  consent of the sender or senders of the messages being investigated)

I take this promise seriously and ask you to trust me.

## Boilerplate Hometown Privacy Policy

What follows is the boilerplate Privacy Policy for Hometown (which is based on
the boilerplate Privacy Policy for Mastodon). All of the below applies to
labyrinth.social, except insofar as it is contradicted, clarified, or further
specified by the above.

### What information do we collect?

* _Basic account information_:
  If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an
  e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile
  information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile
  picture and header image. The username, display name, biography, profile
  picture and header image are always listed publicly.
* _Posts, following and other public information_:
  The list of people you follow is listed publicly, the same is true for your
  followers. When you submit a message, the date and time is stored as well as
  the application you submitted the message from. Messages may contain media
  attachments, such as pictures and videos. Public and unlisted posts are
  available publicly. When you feature a post on your profile, that is also
  publicly available information. Your posts are delivered to your followers, in
  some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are
  stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise delivered to your
  followers. The action of reblogging or favouriting another post is always
  public.
* _Direct and followers-only posts_:
  All posts are stored and processed on the server. Followers-only posts are
  delivered to your followers and users who are mentioned in them, and direct
  posts are delivered only to users mentioned in them. In some cases it means
  they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. We make a
  good faith effort to limit the access to those posts only to authorized
  persons, but other servers may fail to do so. Therefore it's important to
  review servers your followers belong to. You may toggle an option to approve
  and reject new followers manually in the settings. _Please keep in mind that
  the operators of the server and any receiving server may view such messages_,
  and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. _Do not
  share any dangerous information over Hometown/Mastodon._
* _IPs and other metadata_:
  When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name
  of your browser application. All the logged in sessions are available for your
  review and revocation in the settings. The latest IP address used is stored
  for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP
  address of every request to our server.

### What do we use your information for?

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:

* To provide the core functionality of Hometown/Mastodon. You can only interact
  with other people's content and post your own content when you are logged in.
  For example, you may follow other people to view their combined posts in your
  own personalized home timeline.
* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with
  other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.
* The email address you provide may be used to send you information,
  notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you
  messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

### How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic
between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password
is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. You may enable two-factor
authentication to further secure access to your account.

### What is our data retention policy?

We will make a good faith effort to:

* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server,
  in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.
* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12
  months.

You can request and download an archive of your content, including your posts,
media attachments, profile picture, and header image.

You may irreversibly delete your account at any time.

### Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to
your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These
cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered

### Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally
identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist
us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as
those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release
your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law,

safety.

Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your
public and followers-only posts are delivered to the servers where your
followers reside, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the
recipients, in so far as those followers or recipients reside on a different
server than this.

When you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of
permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your
following list, your followers, your lists, all your posts, and your favourites.
Applications can never access your e-mail address or password.
