*   Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names
*   Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate
*   Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop.

*   Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
*   Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
*   Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
*   Publication of non-harassing private communication
*   Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.
*   Microaggressions, which take the form of everyday jokes, put downs, and insults that spread humiliating feelings to people of marginalized groups

The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:

*   "Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"
*   Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."
*   Communicating in a "tone" you don't find congenial
*   Criticism of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Privacy

Respect the privacy of all posts on labyrinth-social. Do not publicly share the contents of any of the following kinds of posts:

* Direct messages
* Followers-only posts
* local-only posts

For further information about privacy, users are encouraged to read our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md)

## Content Warnings

Members of labyrinth.social are expected to use mastodon's content warnings to mark any posts containing the following kinds of content:

 * nsfw or sexually explicit imagery or discussion
 * discussions or depictions of violence
 * potentially upsetting visual imagery (i.e., imagery that may trigger common phobias, or potential trauma triggers)
 * spoilers for recent media releases

Accounts devoted primarily to any of the above listed content types are not encouraged on labyrinth.social. 

Users are encouraged, but by no means required, to use Content Warnings for other types of content that are not listed above, but which other users may want to opt in to seeing on their timeline, for instance content that is upsetting or even merely annoying.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of labyrinth.social, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an administrator (listed at the top of this document) directly or file a report using the Mastodon reporting system (click the "..." on a post and then use the reporting feature). 

This code of conduct applies to labyrinth.social, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.

The admins reserve the right to exclude people from labyrinth.social based on their past behavior, including behavior outside labyrinth.social spaces and behavior towards people who are not in labyrinth.social. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all labyrinth.social spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other labyrinth.social members or the general public.

## Updates

The administrators reserve the right to update the Code of Conduct at any time at their discretion. Updates to the CoC will be communicated to users via email and posts from admin accounts. If you have any concerns about or suggestions for the CoC, please contact an administrator via DM.
