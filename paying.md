## Donations

I pay for labyrinth.social out of pocket, and am happy to do so for now, although that may not always be the case (see the [Terms of Service](policy/terms.md) for more on ongoing availability).

However, I welcome donations from labyrinth users (or anyone really!) to assist with the costs outlined above. For that purpose, I have set up a [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/labsoc) page where you can make a one time or monthly donation. This is completely optional! But any help you provide is appreciated.
