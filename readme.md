About labyrinth.social
======================

Why "Labyrinth?"
----------------

It's an interesting image/word that has a lot of different resonances.
Mythology, design, architecture, puzzles, David Bowie in very tight pants, etc

My direct inspiration for using it comes from Jorge Luis Borges' 1941 short
story "[The Garden of Forking Paths](http://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf)"
which is good and you should read it.

But that alone wouldn't have made it a very good name. Not everyone has read
Borges and not everyone will. I wanted to pick something that could mean
different things to different people, or just mean nothing at all and be kind of
a regular word.

So, Labyrinth. Labyrinth social. "lab-soc" for short. You can pronounce it
"lab-sosh" or "lab-sock" or "lab-sose" or "lab-sauce" or make up your own.

Why this project?
-----------------

I'll write more about this in the future. My rationale is partially described
in [this thread](https://mastodon.cloud/@nowwearealltom/108193926000733916) and
there is a great [guide by Darius Kazemi](https://runyourown.social) about
running your own social network which overlaps with my thinking in some key
ways. Kazemi is also the creator and maintainer of Hometown (which is the
"fork", or variant, of Mastodon that this server uses).

Roadmap
-------
A roadmap for the project is maintained [here](roadmap.md).

Who will I invite?
------------------

Please don't feel slighted if I don't ever choose to invite you because I am
only ever going to invite a small number of people.

I'm not sure exactly how I'll decide who to invite but these are the criteria
I'll be thinking about.

* you and I know each other, and we've been friendly acquaintances for at least
  a year or two.
* you are pretty sure you're sincerely interested in being an active user.
  Ideally this means you're already into the fediverse or very very excited to
  jump in. I don't think I'm going to want to bring on people who are "just
  checking it out to see what it's all about", but I totally encourage those
  people to join another instance, maybe one of the big general instances, and
  then maybe it'll make sense to move here later.
* you and I have relatively similar values. if you are not comfortable using
  people's preferred names and pronouns, or you think "antifa" refers to
  something bad or scary, this is probably not a great place for you
* you have considered the security risks inherent to mastodon, and the risks of
  trusting some friend of yours who runs a mastodon server. Some further notes
  and explanations are posted [here](security.md).

If you think you fit those criteria and you'd be interested to join when I'm
ready, then reach out to me and let me know!

P.S.: If you're thinking of joining the fediverse and you figure you'll just
wait til this place is ready, please don't wait on me because I can't guarantee
it'll ever happen. [jump in](http://joinmastodon.org/) and you can always move
here later if it makes sense for me to invite you.

Hometown Features
-----------------

This server uses Hometown, a fork of mastodon that has been altered to add some
additional features. See
[the Hometown wiki](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) for a quick
explanation. More will be added here later.

Emoji
-----

This instance uses <a href='https://mutant.tech'>Mutant Standard emoji</a>,
which are licensed under a
<a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/'>Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.

For the moment, I have chosen to add only a small subset of these emoji, most
notably the custom flags and symbols from their Gender, Sexuality, and
Relationships category. Other emojis from that set (or any other source) can be
added by request to the admin.

Users can tag their posts as "local only" by using the :local\_only: emoji,
which looks like this:
<img
  src="https://labyrinth.social/system/custom_emojis/images/000/008/282/static/aeeb24f12d632bd6.png"
  alt=":local_only:" title=":local_only:"
  style="vertical-align: middle; -o-object-fit: contain; object-fit: contain;
         margin: -.2ex .15em .2ex; width: 16px; height: 16px;"
/>
You can also just type ":local\_only:" in your toot, colons included.
That works as well. See [Hometown Features](#hometown-features) for more info
on local only posting.
