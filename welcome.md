# Welcome to labyrinth.social

Hi! If you're reading this then I presume that it's because I've invited you to join [labyrinth.social](https://labyrinth.social), my Mastodon server. 

There's a couple of things we need to go over before you can decide whether you would like to join, so please take a look at this document. Also bear in mind that **it is absolutely mandatory that you read the [Code of Conduct](policy/conduct.md)** if you would like to join.

## What is labyrinth.social?

labyrinth.social is a small Mastodon server for friends of Tom Dickinson. If you don't know what Mastodon is, or only kind of know what it is, I recommend you read [What is Mastodon? Why is Mastodon? How is Mastodon?](https://www.nowwearealltom.com/what-is-mastodon/), my guide designed for curious newbies.

Actually, labyrinth.social doesn't use the regular version of Mastodon, it uses an alternate version called [Hometown](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown) which is completely compatible with Mastodon, but has some extra features. 

For a fuller and more detailed explanation of labyrinth.social and what it's all about, check out the [about page/readme](readme.md) if you have not read that already.

This server is small and I intend to keep it that way, but if I've invited you and you're interested in accepting, let's grow it by one user, shall we?

## What do I need to know before joining?

**It's absolutely mandatory that you read the [Code of Conduct](policy/conduct.md)** before joining labyrinth.social. No exceptions. Read it!

I think you might also want to read: 

* **The [about page/readme](readme.md)**, which has general information about mastodon, hometown, and this instance.
* **[Terms of Service](policy/terms.md)**: This has contains general information about the operation of the service, including Admin rights, availability of service, and blacklisting/silencing of other instances. I wrote most of this myself, it's not standard boilerplate.
* **[Privacy Policy](policy/privacy.md)** This document explains what kind of data is collected by labyrinth.social, how it is used, and how it is protected. Again, I wrote most of this myself, it's not standard boilerplate.
* **[Invitation Policy](policy/invitation.md)**: This document provides some information about how I will decide whether or not to invite someone.
* **The guide to [local-only posting](local-only.md)** on labyrinth.social, if you'd like to use that feature.

## Who can I follow? Who should I follow? 

I highly recommend you follow [@admin](https://labyrinth.social/@admin). This is the account I use to make important announcements like server updates, scheduled downtime, policy changes, etc. etc.

You can browse the users of labyrinth.social in the [profile directory](https://labyrinth.social/explore), although some have opted out of appearing in the directory. I recommend that you get to know the other labyrinth.social users, because I think they are cool, and the are the people who can read your local-only posts if you choose to use that feature.

## I have some questions about using Mastodon.

At some point, I might write something up myself, providing some info to familiarize you with Mastodon functionality. But I haven't gotten around to that yet. For now, I recommend [FediTips](https://fedi.tips). Or just post your questions on Mastodon, there are lots of friendly helpful people who can assist you. I'm also happy to answer any additional questions if you reach out to me. 

## What if I run into problems? 

If you run into problems with the site not working, let me know. You can send a mention or direct message to [@admin](https://labyrinth.social/@admin), or you can let me know in whatever way.

If you see a post or a user, you can report them by clicking the ... button and selecting report. You can (and should!) do this for any misbehaving user you see, regardless of whether it's a labyrinth.social user or someone using another server. When you file a report, it goes to the admin of labyrinth.social, not the admin of the other server, although there will be a checkbox asking you if you want to forward it to the admin of the other server as well. I leave that up to you.

Other servers don't necessarily follow the same rules as us, but it's still worth reporting so I can look into it and take action to block or silence that user if needed. Or their whole server, if that's called for. 

## I'm interested, but there's an important question you haven't answered!

Really? Okay! Please tell me what it is so I can answer it and possibly add it to this welcome guide.

## Okay, I'm in! How do I join?

Just let me know you're ready! Reach out to me using the same communication channel where I reached out to you, and be sure to respond with the secret word. If you don't know what the secret word is, then please make sure you have read the Code of Conduct.
